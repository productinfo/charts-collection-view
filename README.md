Building the project
------------------

In order to build this project you'll need a copy of ShinobiCharts. If you don't have it yet, you can download a free trial from the [ShinobiCharts website](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/ios/shinobicharts).

If you're using the trial version you'll need to add your trial key. To do so, open up ViewController.m and edit the following line in `viewDidLoad`:

    ShinobiCharts.setTrialKey("") //Trial Users - Set your trial key here
